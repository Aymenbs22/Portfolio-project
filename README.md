## The Story Of The project
One day I went to the barber to cut my hair for an important event
And I went too late to the event because the barbershop was full
And it wasn't organized, I felt like I was wasting my time
I said to myself why can't I make a website where you can make an appointment with a barber

## Summary

This project is a big challenge for me
This is just the start because I have many ideas and that's why I do my best to study and learn new techniques to make my ideas realizable
I feel so good when I remember how I inspired the idea and now after I have worked on it and the idea will be confirmed and 
I am sure that the way that I am thinking is futuristic
I think computer scientists should be sometimes thinking about the future and sociable to know every generation how thinking and how his idea is acceptable to people because every people have their mentality 
maybe my idea is a new vision in Tunisia because there is no one using an app like this
